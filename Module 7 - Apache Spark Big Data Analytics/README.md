# Big Data Analytics with Spark
### Assignment overview
In this assignment, you will perform a number of tasks to analyse search terms on the e-commerce webserver. You will work in Watson Studio and within a Jupyter notebook to run your analysis against a CSV file containing the webserver data. You will load this file into a Spark dataframe and print the results of your queries against this dataset. You will then load a pretrained sales forecasting model and use this to predict the sales for 2023. After performing each task, take a screenshot of the code you used and its output, and name the screenshot.
